<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
  This SRFI describes, for sufficiently POSIX-compatible systems,
  a portable interface for compiling Scheme programs
  conforming to the R7RS to binaries that can be directly executed on the
  host system.
</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>
  There are currently no issues.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>
While the R7RS describes portable Scheme programs, it does not
describe how to actually store and run such a Scheme program together
with its libraries on a host system. This makes it impossible to write
portable scripts (including
<em>Makefile</em>s) that involve compiling and running Scheme programs.
</p>

<p>
  This situation of Scheme can be compared to the C language. While ISO
  C does define the syntax and semantics of C programs, it leaves out
  questions how C programs are compiled and run on the host
  system. Contrary to Scheme programs, however, there also exists a
  portable interface for compiling and running C programs (at least on
  POSIX-conforming systems), namely the description of the <em>c99</em>
  utility in the POSIX standard.
</p>

<p>
  It is the purpose of this SRFI to describe an analogous interface
  for Scheme programs conforming to the R7RS. The description assumes
  a sufficiently POSIX-compatible system, not because it needs any very
  POSIX-specific features but because POSIX is a host system interface
  that has been standardized. <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, this specification
  also applies to host systems with a similar file and command line
  interface as described by POSIX, like Windows.
</p>

<p>
  While this SRFI speaks of <em>compiling</em> Scheme programs, the interface
  described by this SRFI applies also to Scheme interpreters. The only
  requirement for the compiler's output is that it is a directly executable
  program on the host machine. In particular, the resulting
  binary is allowed to call an interpreter to execute the actual Scheme program.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2>Utilities</h2>

<p>The following description of the utility described by this SRFI follows in form
  roughly the description of <em>c99</em> of the POSIX standard.
</p>

<h3>Name</h3>

compile-r7rs &ndash; compile R7RS programs

<h3>Synopsis</h3>

<pre>
  compile-r7rs [<em>options</em>...] [<em>pathname</em>]
</pre>

<h3>Description</h3>

The <code>compile-r7rs</code> utility is an interface to a compiler
for Scheme programs conforming to the R7RS. The
program <em>pathname</em> (if present) shall be compiled to produce an
executable file. The resulting executable file shall be written to the
file specified by the <strong>-o</strong> option (if present) or to
the file <em>file</em> if <em>pathname</em> is of the
form <em>file</em>.<strong>scm</strong>. (Implementations on Windows
would choose <em>file</em>.<strong>exe</strong> instead
of <em>file</em>.)

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>
The following options shall be supported:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>-D</strong> <em>name</em></dt>
  <dd>
    Add <em>name</em> to the list of feature identifiers maintained by the Scheme implementation
    for the purpose of executing the program in the text file <em>pathname</em>.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>-A</strong> <em>directory</em></dt>
  <dd>
    Append <em>directory</em> to the list of directories that are searched in order to locate
    imported libraries.
    <dt><strong>-I</strong> <em>directory</em></dt>
  <dd>
    Prepend <em>directory</em> to the list of directories that are searched in order to locate
    imported libraries.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>-o</strong> <em>outfile</em></dt>
  <dd>
    Use the pathname <em>outfile</em>, instead of the default <strong>a.out</strong>, for the
    executable file produced.
  </dd>
  <dt>
</dl>

<p>Multiple instances of the <strong>-D</strong>, <strong>-A</strong>, and <strong>-I</strong>
  options can be specified.
</p>

<h3>Operands</h3>

<p>
  If exactly one <em>pathname</em> operand of the
  form <i>file</i>.<b>scm</b> is specified, the application shall
  behave as specified. If the operand is not of this form, the
  behaviour is unspecified.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Rationale: This allows an implementation to support additional file types, e.g. top-level
    programs written for the R6RS, by assigning different extensions to these file types.</i>
</p>

<p>
  If no such operand is given, the application may do nothing or compile the
  library definitions contained in text files in the directories (and its subdirectories)
  specified by the <strong>-A</strong>, and <strong>-I</strong> options into
  an implementation-defined format.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Rationale: In implementations supporting precompilation of
    libraries, libraries are usually precompiled when they are installed as this may need
    administrator privileges depending on the file system location of the libraries. Thus
    the above description ensures that compilation of a program can be split into two phases,
    one happening at library installation time, the other happening when the final executable
    is build from the program source.</i>
</p>

<h3>Input Files</h3>

<p>
  The input file shall be a text file containing a R7RS program.
</p>

<h3>Environment Variables</h3>

The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <i>compile-r7rs</i>:

<dl>
  <dt>COMPILE_R7RS</dt>
  <dd>
    If set to a non-empty pathname, which is not the pathname of the
    running <i>compile-r7rs</i>, the application should forward
    execution to the program specified by <i>COMPILE_R7RS</i> passing to it
    the environment and all its arguments.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <i>Rationale: If more than one Scheme system conforming to this
      SRFI is installed on the host system, this allows for easy
      selection between the Scheme compilers by setting the
      <i>COMPILE_R7RS</i> variable accordingly, and running the <i>compile-r7rs</i> provided
      by either system.</i>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Exit Status</h3>

<p>
  The following exit values shall be returned:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>0</dt>
  <dd>Successful compilation.</dd>
  <dt>&gt;0</dt>
  <dd>An error occurred.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Output file</h3>

The format of the executable file produced is unspecified (e.g. it may
be a shell script).  It is unspecified whether the libraries imported
from the program are statically linked in the executable file. Thus,
if a <em>directory</em> specified by a <strong>-A</strong>,
or <strong>-I</strong> option is not an absolute pathname, the
resulting executable file may not be relocatable in the file system.

<h3>Extended Description</h3>

<h4>Location of Libraries</h4>

<p>
As the R7RS does not describe a mapping between library names and text files
containing library
definitions, this SRFI defines such a mapping as follows: First of all, a library name
<code>(&lt;library name element&gt; ... &lt;library name element&gt;)</code> is mapped to the
(relative) pathname <code>&lt;library name element&gt;/.../&lt;library name
  element&gt;<b>.sld</b></code>.
If the input file processed by <code>compile-r7rs</code> directly or indirectly imports a library,
the application searches an implementation-defined list of directories (which is amended by the
<strong>-A</strong> and <strong>-I</strong> options) for the pathname corresponding to the
library until a valid text file containing a library definition for the imported library is
found.
</p>

<p>
This SRFI does not specify whether this algorithm applies to the standard libraries described
by the R7RS. 
</p>

<p>
  The algorithm is unspecified if the mapping from library names to pathnames produces invalid
  pathnames on the host system (e.g. if a library name element contains a null character).
</p>

<p>
  As the mapping from library names to pathnames is not injective (a library name element may
  contain a slash, for example), implementations are encouraged to allow more than one library
  definition in a text file that is located by this algorithm.
</p>

<p>
  The application may use compiled versions of the library definitions that are produced by running
  the utility without a <em>pathname</em> argument instead of the library definitions itself.
</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
  In order for a host system to implement this specification, firstly,
  it has to provide a command named <i>compile-r7rs</i>, and secondly, this command
  has to fulfill the command-line arguments interface as described above.
</p>

<p>
  For a Scheme system to implement this specification, it is enough to
  provide the second layer, that is a command,
  say <i>compile-fantastic-scheme</i>, that conforms to the
  command-line arguments interface as described above, and to ask the
  user to create a symlink from <i>compile-fantastic-scheme</i> to
  a <i>compile-r7rs</i> pathname. (A Scheme system may alternatively
  provide an option at install time specifying whether the
  command <i>compile-r7rs</i> should be installed automatically.)
<p>

<p>
  <i>Rationale: If a conforming Scheme implementation was forced to
  install <i>compile-r7rs</i> automatically, several such Scheme
  implementations in one host system would likely step on each other's
  toes. So in the case of more than one conforming Scheme
  implementation, it is really the system administrator's or
  the distribution tools' matters to provide <i>compile-r7rs</i> as the command
  name.</i>
</p>

<h2>Sample Implementation</h2>

<p>
There exists no portable implementation (otherwise this SRFI would be moot), so each Scheme
implementation supporting this SRFI should ship its own implementation. There are
Scheme systems that already implement most of this SRFI: Chibi and Larceny implement the
library location algorithm described above. Chibi implements the <strong>-D</strong>,
<strong>-A</strong>, and <strong>-I</strong> options. Larceny implements compiling library
definitions into an implementation-defined format.
</p>

<p>
A not very sophisticated sample implementation for Chibi Scheme is
provided as a <a href="chibi/compile-r7rs">shell script</a> for
readers to read and experiment with. (In order for
the <strong>-D</strong> flag to be supported, a post-0.7.3-release
version of Chibi is needed.)
</p>

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>
This SRFI is related to, but not overlapping with SRFI 22. While SRFI 22 describes how Scheme
script executables can be written without invoking a compiler, this SRFI does not assume that
the compiled file is in any human-readable format. Furthermore, this SRFI assumes an underlying
implementation of R7RS and specifies how to locate libraries supplementary to the standard
libraries, which is not possible with SRFI 22. Thus, neither SRFI makes the other obsolete.
</p>

<p>
The specification of
<em>c99</em> by the POSIX standard and the Chibi and Larceny implementations of R7RS were
influential while this SRFI was written.
